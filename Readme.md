## Refactoring for Deeper Understanding

A workshop I ran at SoCraTes 2022 that shows how to introduce Value Objects into your codebase, and why.


### Compiling the slides

If you want to compile the slides yourself, please checkout my repo
https://github.com/NicoleRauch/PraesentationsGrundlagen
and place it somewhere in your system. Then adapt the liee
```
\newcommand{\PathToConfig}{../root_directory_of_praesentations_grundlagen/} % Important: Terminate with Slash!
```
to point to where that repo is located. This will allow you to compile the slides with LaTeX.
