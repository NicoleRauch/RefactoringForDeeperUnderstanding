\begin{itemize}
\item Is the amount a monetary value? What about rounding?
\item Should we really use \texttt{double} for monetary values?
\item Is the discount a monetary amount that gets subtracted?
\item Or is the discount a percentage that is used to divide the amount?
\item Is a percentage of 5\% passed as 5.0 or as 0.05?
\item Is the return value just the discount or the discounted amount?
\item Is it easy to mess up the invocation by accidentally swapping parameters?
\item $\ldots$
